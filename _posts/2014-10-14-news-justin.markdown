I'm excited to announce I have an interview with Fetch Rewards on Thursday.

* [Wristify](http://www.embrlabs.com/) is in the news! It's a great bracelet that regulates your body temperature. It was a finalist in the Intel Wearables challenge.

* [Humble Mozilla Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com) - You can play awesome games in your browser (or on Steam) and support the open and free web!

* Gave up on Ruby, so I've been trying to get back into php development. Symfony is a good framework, so I might check it out.

* MSFT stock is cheap.  $43.73/share today instead of $46.78 which it was at last Wednesday. I think it suffered because of some backlash against the CEO's stance on women in IT. It will most likely blow over.

* Bought the new Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness CD! It's best song is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzCnzlssQ4Y).

* I found a great site featuring examples of screw-ups in the IT world. It really hit home. :) [The Daily WTF](http://thedailywtf.com)
