* I'm working on putting a playlist tag function on my "tagcloud" project (it's really just a user-created band/song/playlist database). Check out my github! I haven't hosted it yet.

* Fall Out Boy released a new song for the movie Big Hero 6!! [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PxOanFjxQ&feature=youtu.be)

* NaNoWriMo starts on November 1. I might do it: [Liedon's Quest](http://nanowrimo.org/participants/justin-rabensdorf/novels/liedon-s-quest)
