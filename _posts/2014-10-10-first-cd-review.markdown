I'm excited to review [Andrew McMahon][andrew-mcmahon]'s new project "Andrew McMahon In The Wilderness." It's his first full-length release as a solo artist after the release of his EP "The Pop Underground" on 4/30/2013.

## Track Listing
1. *Canyon Moon* - A very dancey, pulsing song with a nice beat. It has a straightforward piano piece in it, nothing too earth-shattering.
2. *Cecilia And The Satellite* - The most catchy, pop-focused song on the album with some nice pulsating bass and synth.
3. *High Dive* - My second favorite song on the album. Such a great beat and an awesome line in the chorus "dancing to someone else's song."
4. *All Our Lives* - His dreamy voice is dreamy.
5. *See Her On The Weekend* - This is definitely the **best** track on the album. This is signature Andrew McMahon. The lyrics are very focused on love and waiting patiently for a loved one while away. The piano track is noticeable and outstanding.
6. *Black And White Movies*
7. *Driving Through A Dream* - This song also makes me think 80s. :)
8. *Halls* - Not as upbeat... Meh. :)
9. *Rainy Girl* - A very slow, simple and old-fashioned love song, and the piano melody sounds like it's from an 80s song.
10. *Maps For The Getaway*

Anybody else buy the album (lowest price I've seen is on [Amazon][amazon-link]) or see him live?

Andrew McMahon In The Wilderness is currently touring with Hunter Hunted, Junior Prom, and Fences.
