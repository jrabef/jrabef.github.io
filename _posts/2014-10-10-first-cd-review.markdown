I'm excited to review [Andrew McMahon][andrew-mcmahon]'s new project "Andrew McMahon In The Wilderness." It's his first full-length release as a solo artist after the release of his EP "The Pop Underground" on 4/30/2013.

Track Listing
1. Canyon Moon
	A very dancey, pulsing song with a nice beat. It has straightforward piano in it, nothing too earth-shattering.
2. Cecilia And The Satellite
		The most catchy, pop-focused song on the album.
3. High Dive
4. All Our Lives
5. See Her On The Weekend
	This is definitely the best track on the album. This is signature Andrew McMahon. The lyrics are very focused on love and waiting patiently for a loved one while away. The piano track is noticeable and outstanding.
6. Black And White Movies
7. Driving Through A Dream
8. Halls
9. Rainy Girl
10. Maps For The Getaway

Anybody going to buy the album on [Amazon][amazon-link] or going to see him live?

Andrew McMahon In The Wilderness is currently touring with Hunter Hunted, Junior Prom, and Fences.
